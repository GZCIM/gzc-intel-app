# GZC Intel App Workspace Location Clarification

## Date: 2025-07-09

### Correct Location Confirmed
`/Users/mikaeleage/Projects Container/GZC Intel App/gzc-intel`

## Workspace Structure Clarification
The application is correctly located in the Projects Container, which exists outside the Research & Analytics Services workspace. This is the proper location for all project repositories with separate repos.

### Workspace Organization:
- **Projects Container**: `/Users/mikaeleage/Projects Container/` - All project repositories
- **Research & Analytics Services**: Agent workspaces and operational files
- **Engineering Workspace**: Scripts and tools, NOT project repositories

## Current Status
✅ Application in correct location (Projects Container)
✅ All components (Portfolio, Analytics) are working
✅ Tab storage system is functional (localStorage, future Redis migration)
✅ Fixed ComponentImportService import error

## Development Commands
```bash
# Navigate to correct location
cd "/Users/mikaeleage/Projects Container/GZC Intel App/gzc-intel"

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Access application
# http://localhost:3500
```

- `MAINTENANCE_NOTES.md` - Complete system status documentation
- `FUTURE_TASKS.md` - Pending tasks including Redis migration
- `docs/migration/` - Component migration documentation

## Note
An incorrect copy was temporarily created in `/Research & Analytics Services/Engineering Workspace/Projects/` but has been removed. The Projects Container is the authoritative location for all project repositories.
